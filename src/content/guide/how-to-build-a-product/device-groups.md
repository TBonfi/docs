Device groups allow you to define subsets of your IoT deployment that can
be addressed directly and separately from the rest of the fleet. Groups provide the flexibility
and granularity needed to manage a connected product at scale. For instance,
a business serving customers around the globe can target devices to run a different
version of firmware depending on the local country's native language.
